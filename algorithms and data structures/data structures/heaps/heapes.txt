Heapes are trees, everything that applies to trees in general applies to heapes.

Binary heap - very similar to binary search tree, but with some
              different rules, left/right nodes are not ordered by value.
              in a MaxBinayHeap, parent nodes are always larger
              than child nodes. in MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always
              smaller than child nodes.

Max Binary Heap - each parent have 2 node childer.
                  the value of a node parent is always greater then the value of
                  child. no guarantee between sibling nodes.
                  binary heap is as compact as possible, all children of each node
                  are full (left & right) before moving onto the next.
                  we fill the left node first, than the right.
